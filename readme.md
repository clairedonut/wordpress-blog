# Wordpress Blog

This project is a showcase example of a blog publishing articles related to the tech industry.

This exercise helped me practice using the Wordpress CMS by customizing a blog's theme and integrating plugins (such as a contact form, slideshow, social media share buttons, a display grid with previews of posts etc). This Wordpress structure is also self-hosted, and was a good exericse to attach the database to the CMS.
